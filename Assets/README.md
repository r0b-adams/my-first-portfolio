# Portfolio

## Description
This project showcases what I've learned so far in my coding bootcamp by applying fundamental HTML and CSS concepts. Utilizing a flexbox layout method simplifies mobile responsiveness for the developer, and mobile responsiveness improves the accessibility of the web application. Creating a portfolio this early into my web development career provides a foundation for future skill application as well as a gallery to demonstrate past work.
